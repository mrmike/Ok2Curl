# Ok2Curl [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrmike/Ok2Curl.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mrmike/Ok2Curl) [![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-Ok2Curl-green.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/2653) [![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/mrmike/Ok2Curl.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#mrmike/Ok2Curl)

Convert OkHttp requests into curl logs.

## Usage
Add library to project dependencies.
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
    // snapshot version
    compile 'com.github.mrmike:ok2curl:master-SNAPSHOT'
    // or use specific version
    compile 'com.github.mrmike:ok2curl:0.3.0'
}
```

To start logging requests with Ok2Curl add interceptor to OkHttp client.
```java
OkHttpClient okHttp = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .addInterceptor(new CurlInterceptor(new Loggable() {
            @Override
            public void log(String message) {
                Log.v("Ok2Curl", message);
            }
        }))
    .build();
```

## Result
With Ok2Curl set up correctly every executed request will be transformed into curl log e.g.
```shell
adb logcat -s "Ok2Curl"
curl -X GET -H "Cache-Control:max-stale=2147483647, only-if-cached" https://api.github.com/repos/vmg/redcarpet/issues?state=closed
```

## Network interceptors
By default Ok2Curl uses application interceptors from OkHttp which is adequate for most cases. But sometimes you may want to use network interceptor e.g. to log Cookies set via [CookieHandler](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/CookieHandler.html). In such a case add interceptor the same way as below:  

```
OkHttpClient okHttp = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .addNetworkInterceptor(new CurlInterceptor())
    .build();
```
